A somewhat simple snake game originally made for a web development class. Controls are both onscreen and the arrow or WASD keys on a keyboard. Eat the dots to grow the snake larger. The red dots momentarily increase the player speed, where the blue dots momentarily decrease the player speed. Yellow dots have no special effects.

It is a violation of the Rice University honor code to look at the code for this game in the course of completing the javaScript Game assignment in COMP431.
